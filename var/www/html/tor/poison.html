	Poisonious things are everywhere around us. Foraging for food in the woods can be rewarding, but it can also be dangerous, especially 
	if you're hunting berries. Some berries are toxic and pose serious health risks if ingested. Below are some of those toxic berries:<p>
	
	<b>Baneberry (Actaea spp.)</b><br>
	<img src=/pics/bane-berry.jpg><br>
	Baneberries, belonging to the Actaea genus, are attractive but deadly wild berries. They are typically found in wooded areas and have 
	distinctive white or red clusters of small round berries. These berries contain cardiogenic toxins, including ranunculin, which can lead 
	to cardiac arrest if ingested. Symptoms of poisoning may include severe gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and even hallucinations. 
	Baneberries are not worth the risk, and it is essential to steer clear of them during your foraging endeavors.<p>
	
	<b>Belladonna (Atropa belladonna)</b><br>
	<img src=/pics/belladonna.jpg><br>
	Belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade, is a highly toxic plant that produces small, shiny black berries. Found in various habitats, 
	including woodlands and wastelands, belladonna contains alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. Ingesting even a few 
	berries can lead to symptoms like blurred vision, convulsions, hallucinations, and potentially fatal respiratory failure. Due to its extreme 
	toxicity, it is crucial to avoid these berries at all costs.<p>
	
	<b>Holly (Ilex spp.)</b><br>
	<img src=/pics/holly-berry.jpg><br>
	Although many holly species are harmless, some varieties produce berries that are poisonous to humans. Holly berries typically have a bright 
	red color, which can be enticing. However, their beauty masks the potential dangers they possess. The compounds in holly berries can cause 
	severe gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some cases, consumption can also lead to dizziness and dehydration. 
	If you are uncertain about the type of holly you encounter, it’s best to err on the side of caution and avoid eating the berries.<p>
	
	<b>Mistletoe (Viscum album)</b><br>
	<img src=/pics/mistletoe.jpg><br>
	Mistletoe is a well-known plant associated with the holiday season, often hung for decorations. However, its berries can be hazardous if ingested. 
	Mistletoe berries contain viscumin, a toxic protein that can cause severe stomach upset and cardiovascular issues. In extreme cases, mistletoe 
	poisoning can be fatal. If you come across mistletoe during your foraging adventures, it is essential to appreciate its beauty from a distance and 
	avoid consuming its berries.<p>
	
	<b>Yew (Taxus spp.)</b><br>
	<img src=/pics/yew-berry.jpg><br>
	Yew is an evergreen tree or shrub found in various regions. While the fleshy red arils surrounding yew seeds might seem edible, the seeds inside 
	are highly toxic. Yew berries contain taxine alkaloids that affect the nervous system and heart. Ingesting even a small number of yew seeds can 
	lead to symptoms such as dizziness, difficulty breathing, and cardiac arrest. It’s essential to be cautious when identifying yew trees and avoid 
	any contact with their berries.<p>
	
	It is crucial to be knowledgeable about the potential dangers lurking in the wilderness. To ensure your safety, avoid consuming any berries that 
	you are uncertain about, especially those discussed here – baneberry, belladonna, holly, mistletoe, and yew berries.<p>

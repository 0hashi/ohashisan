			Reddirt.lab is my demo/test lab running on VMWare ESXi, incorporating Windows and Linux Servers.
			Microsoft SQL Server databases hold application data, and MySQL is the database backend of
			this lab. Additionally, it includes a couple of Cisco routers, a NETGEAR switch, and mindless hub.
			Naturally, there's always a laptop (at least one) connected via either wired or wireless, and there are
			the typical array of cellphones and ubiquitous IoT devices found in most households nowadays. The diagram
			below provides a simplified overview of my lab, with certain details omitted for obvious reasons.

			Welcome to Ohashisan.com, my corner of the internet! If you're here, you've more than likely stumbled upon my website.
			There are no items for sale or malicious content of any kind, and it probably won't pique the interest of
			most internet dwellers. Nevertheless, if you've made it this far, consider yourself welcome to my digital
			playground in Cyberspace! Occasionally, I indulge in updates, tweaks, and even complete overhauls of this
			site, so don't be surprised if you come back and things look entirely different.
			<p>
			I've been in the IT world for a long time and I use this platform as a central repository for my ideas,
			ensuring accessibility from any place on earth. Leveraging <a href="https://github.com/0hashi">GitHub</a>,
			enables me to manage updates and additions, guarantees I won't lose my work and gives me peace-of-mind
			and effortless recovery for this site and my scripts. In a loose sense, or better yet, a broad and flexible
			way, GitHub is a backup strategy and is therefore a big part of the disaster recovery plan for ohashisan.com.
			This gives me full backups of my data and scripts every time I push changes to GitHub. No need for full,
			differential, or incremental backups doing it this way. Know that this is not the correct way for a real
			company to consider disaster recovery, but for a personal web site hosted on a SOHO network, it's perfect!

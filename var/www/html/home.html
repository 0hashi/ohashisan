			reddirt.lab is my demo/test environment built on VMWare ESXi, running Windows and Linux Servers
			and a few bare metal systems, a couple Cisco routers, a NETGEAR switch and a mindless HUB or two.
			Of course there's always a laptop or two connected via wire or WiFi along with the usual suspect
			cellphones and all of the obvious IoT devices that most homes have nowadays. The diagram below is a
			pseudo representation of my lab with a few missing details, for obvious reasons (obvious to me).

			ohashisan.com is my domain on the interwebs, so if you're reading this page you've found my
			web site. There's nothing for sale here, nothing malicious, and probably nothing of interest for
			most people, but if you made it this far, I say, welcome to my digital playground in Cyberspace!
			<p>
			I've been in the IT world for a long time and I use this site to host many of my notes and thoughts
			in one place, and I can access it from anywhere in the world. I use a GitHub repository to keep up
			with my changes and additions. GitHub is also a big part of the business continuity

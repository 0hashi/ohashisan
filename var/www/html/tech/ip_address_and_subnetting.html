			<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
			There's a lot of stuff involved with IP addresses and it's not the easiest part of networking... There's 
			the binary system, the base(2) system, the decimal system, there are bits and bytes, there are
			octets, there are classes A, B, C, D and E, and a few other things involved with getting one computer 
			to communicate with antother.<p>

			I'm sure I left a few things out, or just forgot to mention so we'll use what I have listed to get started.<p>

			<li>1 binary number is a "bit" (0 or 1).
			<li>8 bits = 1 byte (00000000 or 11111111).
			<li>1 octet = 1 byte (11111111.00000000.octet.octet).
			<li>An IP address/subnet mask has 4 octets (IP address: 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0).
			<li>There are 256 (0 - 255) possibilities for each octet.<p>

			
			Now, let's start with the image below. Using the full range of possibilities (256) divided in half
			(= 128), then divide the quotient in half 7 times, then put each result in its own column (like the table
			below) you'll have everything you need to convert binary to decimal for each octet in an IPv4 address.<p>

			<p><center><img src="./pics/ip_addressing.jpg" width=40%></center><p>

			There are a couple ranges when it comes to Public ("routable") IP addresses -vs- Private IP addresses
			("non-routable"). I try to show those ranges in the table below.

				If you're familiar with converting decimal to binary, there may be an easier way to figure out what class
				an IP address is...at least for me it's easier than trying to remember class ranges (1 - 126, 128 - 191,
				192 - 223, 224 - 239 and 240 - 254). I don't know, maybe its not easier?<p>
				A = 0xxxxxxx<br>
				B = 10xxxxxx<br>
				C = 110xxxxx<br>
				D = 1110xxxx<br>
				E = 1111xxxx This class is reserved for something...

			<tr><td colspan=2>
				<b>Special Addresses:</b><p>
				127.0.01 = Loopback address<br>
				169.254.x.x = APIPA address (Automatic Private IP Address)<p>
				APIPA is a feature in operating systems (such as Windows) that enables computers to automatically
				self-configure an IP address and subnet mask when their DHCP server isn't reachable.<p>

			<h2>Subnetting</h2>
			A subnet, or subnetwork is a network inside a network. So, essentially a subnet is a network. Confused?
			The function of a subnet mask is to differentiate the <b>network bits</b> from the <b>host bits</b> in an IP
			address.

			Well, if that didn't make you want to drink, maybe this next part will. And, if this next part doesn't make
			you want to chug some whiskey, the part after this most certainly will. Actually, I'm going to work through
			this tid-bit of information with a "cheet sheet". It's not my cheet sheet and I'm not sure who came up with
			it, because I've seen it several different places. Two thumbs up to the person that created it!<p>

			Take a gander at the image below. If you have an IPv4 address and a CIDR or Subnet mask, you should be able to 
			figure out several other things (7 to be exact): The <b>Network ID,</b> the <b>Broadcast IP, </b> the <b>Firts Host IP,</b>
			the <b>Last Host IP,</b> the <b>Next Network,</b> the <b># of IPs,</b> and the <b>CIDR or subnet</b><p>

			If my ramblings are confusing then you know how I felt when I started this journey. The web site subnetipv4.com
			helped me figure things out. This site has some really good, short videos that explain all of the things you need
			to understand about subnetting and it has a cool subnetting calculator that generates random IP addresses so you can practice.<p>

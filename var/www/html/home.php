			Welcome to Ohashisan.com, this is my little corner on the internet. If you're here, you've more than likely
			stumbled upon this site, or I mentioned it in a conversation and for some off-the-wall reason you decided to
			take a look at it. Either way, I'm glad you're here and I hope you find something of interest.
		</p>

			There are no widgets or gadgets for sale, nothing evil or malicious, and no "buyer beware" warning. Other
			than the two bundles of joy below, there isn't much to pique the interest of the common internet dweller.
			Nevertheless, if you've made it this far, consider yourself welcome to my digital playground in Cyberspace!
			Occasionally, I partake in updates, tweaks, and even complete overhauls of this site, so don't be surprised
			if you come back and things look entirely different.
		<p>
			<!-- I've been in the IT world for a long time and I use this platform as a central repository for my ideas,
			ensuring accessibility from any place on earth. Leveraging <a href="https://github.com/0hashi">GitHub</a>,
			enables me to manage updates and additions, guarantees I won't lose my work and gives me peace-of-mind
			and effortless recovery for this site and my scripts. In a loose sense, or better yet, a broad and flexible
			way, GitHub is a backup strategy and is therefore a big part of the disaster recovery plan for ohashisan.com.
			This gives me full backups of my data and scripts every time I push changes to GitHub. No need for full,
			differential, or incremental backups doing it this way. Know that this is not the correct way for a real
			company to consider disaster recovery, but for a personal web site hosted on a SOHO network, it's perfect! -->

			Meet Pebbles and Boogie. Like that old television show from the 70's, "The Odd Couple", these two dogs have
			a wonderful and hilarious love/hate relationship with each other. And, just like the TV series, Oscar (Pebbles)
			is a sloppy (slobbish) sportswriter and Felix (Boogie) is a well-mannered, neat, clean and maybe a little OCD,
			photographer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pebbles (on the left) is the younger of the two; she was probably a little over a year old when the photo was
			taken. In 2018, my wife and I rescued her from the animal shelter in Norco, California, and she's been an
			awesome addition to our family ever since. Boogie (on the right) joined the family in 2011. A good friend
			of mine found him wandering the streets of Fontana, California, and for some reason, he thought I needed a
			dog. He was exactly right!

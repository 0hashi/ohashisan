Ohashisan README.md

This project is my website (www.ohashisan.com). I've been rebuilding it using PHP and a MySQL database (LAMP). I use this site to enhance my web development and scripting skills, keep notes on things that interest me, and store information that's easy to forget if not used regularly. Some web pages are built with PHP, others with Python. I use GitHub to simplify code changes, especially when switching between my laptop and workstation. It also allows easy migration between systems without needing to restore from backup. It's just my playground in cyberspace.

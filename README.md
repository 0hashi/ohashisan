Ohashisan README.md

This project is my web site (www.ohashisan.com). For most people it probably isn't an extermely interesting web site. I use my web site to keep notes about the things that interest me and for stuff that's easy to forget if I'm not using the information on a reqular basis. I keep the site on GitHub for the purpose of easily move it from system to system without restoring from backup. Although, backups would be much more secure from a security perspective, there isn't any sensitive information here. 

I host these web pages on a Linux system, so there is one thing to keep in mind, I use symlinks for index.html pages (eg. ln -s home.html index.html and likewise for subdirectories).

These files, images and scripts, and the information they contain are provided "as is" and without warranty or support of any kind. Permission is granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this information, to modify its contents without restriction, merge, publish or distribute. Enjoy!

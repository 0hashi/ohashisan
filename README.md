Ohashisan README.md

This project is for my web site (www.ohashisan.com). For most people it probably won't be an interesting site. I use my this site to keep notes about the things that interest me and for stuff that's easy to forget if I'm not using the information on a reqular basis. I keep the site on GitHub for the purpose of easily moving it from system to system without having to restore from backup. Although, backups would be much more secure, there isn't any sensitive information here. It's just my playground in Cyberspace.
